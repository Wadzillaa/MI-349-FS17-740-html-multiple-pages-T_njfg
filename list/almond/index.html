    <h1>Almond</h1>
    <p>Almonds are the top nut, as far as I'm concerned, and this is my website,
      so I'm right. The almond was found in the Middle East in early times,
      and is now widely enjoyed by the larger world. Almonds can be eaten plain,
      salted, coated in chocolate, and even ground into butter, all the while
      being a healthy, protein filled snack! Yes, the almond really is
      nature's greatest bounty.</p>
