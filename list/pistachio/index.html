    <h1>Pistachio</h1>
    <p>This entry might ruffle some nut shell husks, but I'm keeping it on my
      list. Despite some health concerns related to pistachios, such as risks of
      weight gain or increased blood pressure(you can read the full list of
      health concerns <a href = "https://goodhealthall.com/side-effects-of-eating-too-many-pistachios-pista/"
      target="_blank"><i>here</i>)</a>, I believe that the pistachio is one of
      the most delectible nuts around, and usually offers a fun challenge to eat
      as you must de-shell them yourself, unless you buy them de-shelled, but at that stage,
      what's the point? They have a green color and a meaty, salty taste
      (usually due to me buying salted pistachios) that is hard to resist.</p>
