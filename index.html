    <h3>A fansite by me, Nathaniel Wadas, to discuss my favorite type of nuts.</h3>
    <h2>Why I made this site.</h2>
    <p>A long time ago, I was eating from a sampler of nuts, including but not
      limited to, cashews, peanuts, and almonds. I thought to myself, <i>"Man,
        I wish I could tell people what my favorite nuts are"</i>, and so, I created
        this website. Click on the link below to go to my list of the top
        nuts!
